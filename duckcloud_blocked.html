			<h2><em>DuckCloud has been locked until ducks are normal again.</em></h2>

		This error page is usually caused by a server restart, because the administrator wants to warn you about that.
		<br>
		Unfortunately, you'll still have to restart your VM to regain Web shell access.

		All your login info is secure and is extended. You can't use DuckCloud right now - try again later.
