		Description about this page:
		<br>
		<em>DuckCloud allows you to create free virtual machines using powerful Docker container technology.</em>
		<br>
		You are using a DuckCloud technology called "Trusted Technician".
		<br>
		You need to ask the user to go into their account settings and create a Trusted Technician session.
		<br>
		Then you ask for the password. If the user trusts you enough, you can input the Trusted Technician password here:
		<br>
		<form action="/trustedTechLogin" method="post">
			<input name="token" type="password" placeholder="DuckCloud Trusted Technician password" pattern="[0-9a-f]{32,32}" required title="DuckCloud Trusted Technician password is the password you need to log into another user's session."></input>
			<br>
			<button>Continue with fixing their stuff...</button>
		</form>
