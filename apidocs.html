		<a href="/main" class="arrow">‚Üê</a> | <b>DuckCloud APIs</b>
        <br>
        The API is free for everybody to use.
        <br>
        By the way, DuckCloud is COMPLETELY open-<a href="https://github.com/PC-trollbox/DuckCloud">source</a>, and you can host it on your computer! (linux is better for selfhosting)
        <hr>
        Your application logs in with a <code>Cookie</code> header - with a <code>token</code> cookie. This is applicable for both HTTP and Socket.IO APIs. The value for <code>Cookie</code> header if the user's token is abcdlol:
        <pre>token=abcdlol</pre>
        <hr>
        <b>Using Node.JS?</b> If you are using POST /login, you can get transparently redirected by <code>fetch</code> and not get logged in. You need to use a package which supports cookies or just don't redirect and get the cookie from headers. Good luck on your app :)
        <hr>
        <h2>HTTP API</h2>
        This is the main part of the API.
        <br>
        <h3>GET <a href="/">/</a></h3>
        Redirects the user to /main if they are logged in, otherwise prompts to log in.
        <hr>
        <h3>GET <a href="/register">/register</a></h3>
        Redirects the user to /main if they are logged in, otherwise prompts to register an account.
        <hr>
        <h3>POST /register</h3>
        Params: encode in JSON or URLencoded
        <br>
        <code>username</code> - DuckCloud ID.
        <br>
        <code>password</code> - DuckCloud secret.
        <br>
        Creates an account, or redirects the user to /main if they are logged in.
        <hr>
        <h3>POST /login</h3>
        Params: encode in JSON or URLencoded
        <br>

        <br>
        Puts a <code>token</code> cookie if the user has successfully logged in, or redirects the user to /main if they are logged in.
        <hr>
        <h3>GET <a href="/main">/main</a></h3>
        <em>This operation requires proper logon. Users will get redirected to / if they have an incorrect token or didn't log in yet.</em>
        <br>
        Shows a GUI with all the VMs. Your application can still request a computer-readable list without worrying about parsing HTML.
        <hr>
        <h3>GET <a href="/listContainer">/listContainer</a></h3>
        <em>This operation requires proper logon. Users will get redirected to / if they have an incorrect token or didn't log in yet.</em>
        <br>
        Sends computer-readable list of VMs. For example:
        <pre>[

        "vmname": "MyVM",
        "vmname_encoded": "MyVM",
        "status": "offline"
    },
    {

        <br>
        If launching failed (like if the user tried to remove all the binaries), a launching failed page will be shown. Otherwise redirects to /main.

        <br>
        <code>username</code> - DuckCloud ID of the new owner.

        <br>
        Tells the pty to adapt to the new dimensions - for example sets process.stdout.columns in Node.JS.
        <hr>
        <h3>GET <a href="/newVM">/newVM</a></h3>
        <em>This operation requires proper logon. Users will get redirected to / if they have an incorrect token or didn't log in yet.</em>

        <br>
        Any bad Socket.IO API call - and you get disconnected. This is a protection measure - the servers should be mostly up.
