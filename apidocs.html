		<a href="/main" class="arrow">‚Üê</a> | <b>DuckCloud APIs</b>
        <br>
        The API is free for everybody to use.
        <br>
        By the way, DuckCloud is COMPLETELY open-<a href="https://github.com/PC-trollbox/DuckCloud">source</a>, and you can host it on your computer! (linux is better for selfhosting)
        <hr>
        Your application logs in with a <code>Cookie</code> header - with a <code>token</code> cookie. This is applicable for both HTTP and Socket.IO APIs. The value for <code>Cookie</code> header if the user's token is abcdlol:
        <pre>token=abcdlol</pre>
        <hr>
        <h2>HTTP API</h2>
        This is the main part of the API.
        <br>
        <h3>GET <a href="/">/</a></h3>
        Redirects the user to /main if they are logged in, otherwise prompts to log in.
        <hr>
        <h3>GET <a href="/register">/register</a></h3>
        Redirects the user to /main if they are logged in, otherwise prompts to register an account.
        <hr>
        <h3>POST /register</h3>
        Params: encode in JSON or URLencoded
        <br>
        <code>username</code> - DuckCloud ID.
        <br>
        <code>password</code> - DuckCloud secret.
        <br>
        Creates an account, or redirects the user to /main if they are logged in.
        <hr>
        <h3>POST /login</h3>
        Params: encode in JSON or URLencoded
        <br>
        <code>username</code> - DuckCloud ID.
        <br>
        <code>password</code> - DuckCloud secret.
        <br>
        Puts a <code>token</code> cookie if the user has successfully logged in, or redirects the user to /main if they are logged in.
        <hr>
        <h3>GET <a href="/main">/main</a></h3>
        <em>This operation requires proper logon. Users will get redirected to / if they have an incorrect token or didn't log in yet.</em>
        <br>
        Shows a GUI with all the VMs. Your application can still request a computer-readable list without worrying about parsing HTML.
        <hr>
        <h3>GET <a href="/listContainer">/listContainer</a></h3>
        <em>This operation requires proper logon. Users will get redirected to / if they have an incorrect token or didn't log in yet.</em>
        <br>
        Sends computer-readable list of VMs. For example:
        <pre>[
    {
        "vmname": "MyVM",
        "vmname_encoded": "MyVM",
        "status": "offline"
    },
    {
        "vmname": "OurVM",
        "vmname_encoded": "OurVM",
        "status": "online"
    }
]</pre>
        <hr>
        <h3>GET <a href="/settings/0">/settings/:vmNumber</a></h3>

        Turns on or turns off a VM. May block the operation - shutting down takes a long time. <em>(fix this, docker!)</em>
        <br>
        If launching failed (like if the user tried to remove all the binaries), a launching failed page will be shown. Otherwise redirects to /main.
        <hr>
        <h3>GET <a href="/chown/0">/chown/:vmNumber</a></h3>

        <br>
        <code>username</code> - DuckCloud ID of the new owner.
        <br>
        Changes ownership of a VM. The new owner must have sharing enabled in their <a href="/manage">settings</a> and also (if has no PRO flag) must have no VMs.
        <br>
        If the operation succeeds, will redirect to /main.
        <hr>
        <h3>GET <a href="/ren/0">/ren/:vmNumber</a></h3>
        <em>This operation requires proper logon. Users will get redirected to / if they have an incorrect token or didn't log in yet.</em>
        <br>
        Shows a GUI renaming panel where the user can change name of a VM, similar to the /chown/ panel.
        <hr>
        <h3>POST /ren/:vmNumber</h3>

        <hr>
        <h3>POST /newVM</h3>

        Basically a protection from skids. They can still load a whole browser, but that's kind of bloat.
        <br>

        <hr>
        <h2>Socket.IO API</h2>
        You should use THIS for I/O on the user's VMs, not the HTTP calls - as HTTP can be easily damaged and it's not that fast as you think.
        <br>
        Any bad Socket.IO API call - and you get disconnected. This is a protection measure - the servers should be mostly up.
        <hr>
        <h3><code>emit("vmselect", Number vmNumber)</code></h3>
        <br>
        Registers your client for usage with the selected VM. Can only be called once!
